                        <li>My interest in coding sparked during the lockdownðŸ¦ . I jumped from <mark>p5js.org</mark> to <mark>code.org</mark> to <mark>Whitehat Junior</mark> and then finally learned JavaScript , HTML5 and CSS3 from a course on <mark>Udemy</mark>. Along the way I created many games on code.org using sprites and made an amazing website using my unpolished front end skills.

                            I have always been curious about how the world functions and participated and succeeded in several activities to quench my thirst. Some of them are Akademi Sempoa Mental Arithmetik UC MAS- Malaysia , Scholars Integral Science Olympiad (SISO), NEST - Make 'n' Market 2019, SRIMUN 2020 , Mahatma Gandhi Rashtrbhasha Hindi Prachar Sanstha (HINDI), National Astronomy & Science Olympiad conducted by NASO Educational Society ( in 13 countries), Vibrants of Kalam.

                            My favorite hobby is verse writing. My latest poem ðŸ“œ is going to be published in a Mega Anthology which is aimed at <mark>Guinness World Rewords</mark> for being the thickest anthology. It even aims for Asia and India Book of Records.
                            Another memorable moment etched in my life is when I met the cricket Star,
                             <mark>Mohammad Azharuddin</mark>, and was fortunate enough to present him my poem which I had written about him. I have started posting my poems on Instagram as well <mark><a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.ethereal.scribe/" target="_BLANK" >@the.ethereal.scribe</a></mark> .
